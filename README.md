# FramboxOS
This script automatticly installs things I need in RetroPie. This makes it easier to get everything running after a chrash / fresh start. It's mainly for personal use only, but I tought I would share it on github.<br><br>
It includes:
- A custom bashwelcometweak
- My favorite splashscreens
- A option to open MCPI and Vice BASIC from emulationtation

It also installs:
- Minecraft Pi, nmap, hping3, python pip
